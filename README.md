# SQL_python_dB_connection
In this project, I tried to show my knowledge of sqlalchemy and also tried to show how to load CSV data into SQL database table. This project also requires some knowledge of SQL workbench.
this project can be done by some other python Modules but this seems to be the easiest way since pandas provide such amazing support in data cleaning.


Module Needed in this project 
```
import pandas as pd
import sqlalchemy

```
Steps required 
1) first we need to create a database in MySQL workbench.
#### Note: Database is called schema in Mysql workbench.
2) we need to import the required modules 
3) Then we need to establish a connection with the Mysql database.
4) we need to make do so required data cleaning and loading it into pandas dataframe.
5) Now we can push data into the database table.
